* Channels

Guix supports the concept of [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html#Channels][channels]] which basically amount to Git repositories which contain Guix package definitions that can be installed on your machine.  Aside from the =%default-channels= list, I also use the [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix][Nonguix]] channel to install packages that aren't included with Guix by default like the non-free Linux kernel.

I also generate my real =.config/guix/channels.scm= file based on this =base-channels.scm= file.  This allows me to keep a pinned channel list in the real channels file while maintaining a canonical channel listing that I generate it from using the =update-channels= script (defined later in this file).

The following channel list can be used when testing patches to packages and services from a local clone of the Guix repo.  You'll have to create a branch and commit changes to it before =guix pull= can pick them up, though.  You can change the target branch using the =branch= field of the =channel=.

* Systems

** Base Configuration

This base configuration is shared between all of the machines I manage with Guix.  Since all of my machines are Lenovo ThinkPad laptops, the same basic configuration applies pretty cleanly across all of them.  This may change in the future.

Any configuration that derives from =base-operating-system= must invoke =guix system= in a specific way to ensure it gets loaded correctly:

#+begin_src sh

sudo guix system -L ~/.dotfiles/.config/guix/systems reconfigure ~/.dotfiles/.config/guix/systems/davinci.scm

#+end_src

** Machines

Because I'm lame, all of my machines are named from characters, things, and places from the movie Hackers.

*** Per-System Settings

Some settings need to be customized on a per-system basis without tweaking individual configuration files.  Thanks to org-mode's =noweb= functionality, I can define a set of variables that can be tweaked for each system and applied across these configuration files when they get generated.

I also define a function called =dw/system-settings-get= which can retrieve these settings appropriately.

** USB Installation Image

To install Guix on another machine, you first to build need a USB image.  Since I use modern laptops that require non-free components, I have to build a custom installation image with the full Linux kernel.  I also include a few other programs that are useful for the installation process.  I adapted this image from [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix/blob/master/nongnu/system/install.scm][one found on the Nonguix repository]], hence the copyright header.

* Profile Management

I like to separate my packages into separate manifests that get installed as profiles which can be updated independently.  These profiles get installed under the =~/.guix-extra-profiles= path and sourced by my =~/.profile= when I log in.

To make the management of multiple profiles easier, I've created a couple of shell scripts:

** Activating Profiles

This script accepts a space-separated list of manifest file names (without extension) under the =~/.config/guix/manifests= folder and then installs those profiles for the first time.  For example:

#+begin_src sh

activate-profiles desktop emacs music

#+end_src

*.bin/activate-profiles:*

#+begin_src sh :tangle .bin/activate-profiles :shebang #!/bin/sh

# NOTE: This file is generated from ~/.dotfiles/System.org.  Please see commentary there.

GREEN='\033[1;32m'
RED='\033[1;30m'
NC='\033[0m'
GUIX_EXTRA_PROFILES=$HOME/.guix-extra-profiles

profiles=$*
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
    profiles="$HOME/.config/guix/manifests/*.scm";
fi

for profile in $profiles; do
  # Remove the path and file extension, if any
  profileName=$(basename $profile)
  profileName="${profileName%.*}"
  profilePath="$GUIX_EXTRA_PROFILES/$profileName"
  manifestPath=$HOME/.config/guix/manifests/$profileName.scm

  if [ -f $manifestPath ]; then
    echo
    echo -e "${GREEN}Activating profile:" $manifestPath "${NC}"
    echo

    mkdir -p $profilePath
    guix package --manifest=$manifestPath --profile="$profilePath/$profileName"

    # Source the new profile
    GUIX_PROFILE="$profilePath/$profileName"
    if [ -f $GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile ]; then
        . "$GUIX_PROFILE"/etc/profile
    else
        echo -e "${RED}Couldn't find profile:" $GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile "${NC}"
    fi
  else
    echo "No profile found at path" $profilePath
  fi
done

#+end_src

** Updating Profiles

This script accepts a space-separated list of manifest file names (without extension) under the =~/.config/guix/manifests= folder and then installs any updates to the packages contained within them.  If no profile names are provided, it walks the list of profile directories under =~/.guix-extra-profiles= and updates each one of them.

#+begin_src sh

update-profiles emacs

#+end_src

*.bin/update-profiles:*

#+begin_src sh :tangle .bin/update-profiles :shebang #!/bin/sh

# NOTE: This file is generated from ~/.dotfiles/System.org.  Please see commentary there.

GREEN='\033[1;32m'
NC='\033[0m'
GUIX_EXTRA_PROFILES=$HOME/.guix-extra-profiles

profiles=$*
if [[ $# -eq 0 ]]; then
    profiles="$GUIX_EXTRA_PROFILES/*";
fi

for profile in $profiles; do
  profileName=$(basename $profile)
  profilePath=$GUIX_EXTRA_PROFILES/$profileName

  echo
  echo -e "${GREEN}Updating profile:" $profilePath "${NC}"
  echo

  guix package --profile="$profilePath/$profileName" --manifest="$HOME/.config/guix/manifests/$profileName.scm"
done

#+end_src

** Updating Channels

This script makes it easy to update all channels to the latest commit based on an original channel file (see the Channels section at the top of this document).

#+begin_src sh :tangle .bin/update-channels :shebang #!/bin/sh

  guix pull --channels=$HOME/.config/guix/base-channels.scm
  guix describe --format=channels > ~/.config/guix/channels.scm

#+end_src

* Dotfiles Management

Since I keep all of my important configuration files in Org Mode code blocks, I have to ensure that the real configuration files are kept up to date when I sync the latest changes to my [[https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles][dotfiles]] repo.  I've written a couple of scripts to simplify that process:

** Syncing

When I want to sync my dotfiles repo into my local clone which likely has uncommitted changes, I run =sync-dotfiles=.  This script first makes sure that all Org files are saved in a running Emacs instance and then stashes everything before pulling the latest changes from =origin=.  After pulling, the stash is popped and then the script verifies there are no merge conflicts from the stash before proceeding.  If there are no conflicts, =update-dotfiles= is run, otherwise I'll fix the merge conflicts manually and run =update-dotfiles= myself.

*.bin/sync-dotfiles*

#+begin_src sh :tangle .bin/sync-dotfiles :shebang #!/bin/sh

# Sync dotfiles repo and ensure that dotfiles are tangled correctly afterward

GREEN='\033[1;32m'
BLUE='\033[1;34m'
RED='\033[1;30m'
NC='\033[0m'

# Navigate to the directory of this script (generally ~/.dotfiles/.bin)
cd $(dirname $(readlink -f $0))
cd ..

echo
echo -e "${BLUE}Saving Org buffers if Emacs is running...${NC}"
emacsclient -u -e "(org-save-all-org-buffers)" -a "echo 'Emacs is not currently running'"

echo -e "${BLUE}Stashing existing changes...${NC}"
stash_result=$(git stash push -m "sync-dotfiles: Before syncing dotfiles")
needs_pop=1
if [ "$stash_result" = "No local changes to save" ]; then
    needs_pop=0
fi

echo -e "${BLUE}Pulling updates from dotfiles repo...${NC}"
echo
git pull origin master
echo

if [[ $needs_pop -eq 1 ]]; then
    echo -e "${BLUE}Popping stashed changes...${NC}"
    echo
    git stash pop
fi

unmerged_files=$(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U)
if [[ ! -z $unmerged_files ]]; then
   echo -e "${RED}The following files have merge conflicts after popping the stash:${NC}"
   echo
   printf %"s\n" $unmerged_files  # Ensure newlines are printed
else
    update-dotfiles
fi

#+end_src

** Updating

Updating my dotfiles requires running a script in Emacs to loop over all of my literate configuration =.org= files and run =org-babel-tangle-file= to make sure all of my configuration files are up to date.

*.bin/update-dotfiles*

#+begin_src sh :tangle .bin/update-dotfiles :shebang #!/bin/sh

  # Navigate to the directory of this script (generally ~/.dotfiles/.bin)
  cd $(dirname $(readlink -f $0))
  cd ..

  # The heavy lifting is done by an Emacs script
  emacs -Q --script ./.emacs.d/tangle-dotfiles.el

  # Make sure any running Emacs instance gets updated settings
  emacsclient -e '(load-file "~/.emacs.d/per-system-settings.el")' -a "echo 'Emacs is not currently running'"

  # Update configuration symlinks
  stow .

#+end_src

*.emacs.d/tangle-dotfiles.el*

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle .emacs.d/tangle-dotfiles.el

  (require 'org)
  (load-file "~/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/lisp/dw-settings.el")

  ;; Don't ask when evaluating code blocks
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)

  (let* ((dotfiles-path (expand-file-name "~/.dotfiles"))
	 (org-files (directory-files dotfiles-path nil "\\.org$")))

    (defun dw/tangle-org-file (org-file)
      (message "\n\033[1;32mUpdating %s\033[0m\n" org-file)
      (org-babel-tangle-file (expand-file-name org-file dotfiles-path)))

    ;; Tangle Systems.org first
    (dw/tangle-org-file "Systems.org")

    (dolist (org-file org-files)
      (unless (member org-file '("README.org" "Systems.org"))
      	(dw/tangle-org-file org-file))))

* Nix Package Manager

In an ironic twist of fate, I've found that certain tools I need to use are more easily available in the Nix package repository, so I use it to install them.

#+begin_src conf :tangle .nix-channels

https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable nixpkgs

#+end_src

The channel needs to be updated before any packages can be installed:

#+begin_src sh

nix-channel --update

#+end_src

Installing packages:

#+begin_src sh

nix-env -i nodejs dotnet-sdk gh hledger
# nix-env -iA nixpkgs.nodejs-12_x # For a specific version

#+end_src

* System Installation

Here's a guide for how I install my GNU Guix systems from scratch.  This process is simplified because I've already prepared a reusable system configuration so you might need to do extra work if you end up following this for your own system install.

** Building the Installation Image

Since I use modern Thinkpads, I have to use the non-free kernel and firmware blobs from the [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix][nonguix]] channel.  After cloning the repo, the installation image can be built with this command:

#+begin_src sh

  # Create a slightly larger install image to have some headroom
  # for temporary file creation and avoid "no space free" errors
  guix system image ./install.scm --image-size=5G

#+end_src

*NOTE:* It can take an hour or more for this to complete, so be patient...

Once the build is complete, Guix will print out the path to the disk image file that was created.  You can now write the installation image to a USB stick using =dd=:

#+begin_src sh

  sudo dd if=/gnu/store/nyg6jv3a4l0pbcvb0x7jfsb60k9qalga-disk-image of=/dev/sdX status=progress

#+end_src

** Installing Guix

With the newly "burned" installation image, boot from the USB drive and choose "Install using the shell based process."

*** Setting up WiFi

Use an editor (or =echo=) to create a new file called =wifi.conf= to store the wifi configuration.  Make sure to set =ssid= to the name of your wifi access point and =psk= to the passphrase for your wifi.  You may also need to change the =key_mgmt= parameter depending on the type of authentication your wifi router supports ([[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wpa_supplicant#Configuration][some examples]] on Arch Wiki).

#+begin_src

  network={
    ssid="ssid-name"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    psk="unencrypted passphrase"
  }

#+end_src

First, run the following commands to unblock the wifi card, determine its device name, and connect using the device name you received from =ifconfig -a=.  In my case it's =wlp4s0= so I run the command like so:

#+begin_src sh

  rfkill unblock all
  ifconfig -a
  wpa_supplicant -c wifi.conf -i wlp4s0 -B

#+end_src

#+begin_quote

*NOTE:* If for any reason running =wpa_supplicant= fails, make sure to kill any background instances of it before trying to run it again because the old instances will block new runs from working.  This wasted a couple hours of my time the first time I tried installing Guix!

#+end_quote

The last step to set up networking is to run =dhclient= to turn on DNS for your wifi connection:

#+begin_src sh

  dhclient -v wlp4s0

#+end_src

*** Setting Up Partitions

Since we're installing on a ThinkPad with UEFI, follow the [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/guix.html#Disk-Partitioning][instructions in the Guix manual]] for disk partitioning.  The short of it is that you need to use =cfdisk= to create a partition in your free space:

#+begin_src sh

  cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1

#+end_src

Once you have your Linux root partition set up, you can enable LUKS to encrypt that partition by running the following commands (where =/dev/nvme0n1p5= is your root partition and =system-root= is an arbitrary label you'd like to use for it):

#+begin_src sh

  cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p5
  cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/nvme0n1p5 system-root
  mkfs.ext4 -L system-root /dev/mapper/system-root
  mount LABEL=system-root /mnt

#+end_src

Finally, make sure to mount your EFI partition to =/mnt/boot= so that the installer can install the bootloader.  The Guix installation instructions obscure this step slightly so it's easy to miss:

#+begin_src sh

  mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
  mount /dev/<EFI partition> /mnt/boot/efi

#+end_src

Now your EFI and encrypted root filesystems are mounted so you can proceed with system installation.  You must now set up the installation enviornment using =herd=:

#+begin_src sh

  herd start cow-store /mnt

#+end_src

*** Initial System Installation

If you've got a system configuration prepared already, you can use =git= to pull it down into the current directory (the one you're already in, not =/mnt=):

#+begin_src sh

  git clone https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles

#+end_src

One important step before you attempt system installation is to set up the =nonguix= channel so that the system can be installed from it.  Once you've cloned your dotfiles repo, you can place your =channels.scm= file into the root user's =.config/guix= path and then run =guix pull= to activate it:

#+begin_src sh

  mkdir -p ~/.config/guix
  cp dotfiles/guix/channels.scm ~/.config/guix
  guix pull
  hash guix  # This is necessary to ensure the updated profile path is active!

#+end_src

The pull operation may take a while depending on how recently you generated your installation USB image (if packages in the main Guix repository have been updated since then).

Once your channels are set up, you will need to tweak your configuration to reflect the partition UUIDs and labels for the system that you are installing.  To figure out the UUID of your encrypted root partition, you can use the following command:

#+begin_src sh

  cryptsetup luksUUID /dev/<root partition>

#+end_src

#+begin_quote

**TIP:** To make it easier to copy the UUID into your config file, you can switch to another tty using =Ctrl-Alt-F4= and press =Enter= to get to another root prompt.  You can then switch back and forth between the previous TTY on =F3=.

#+end_quote

Now you can initialize your system using the following command:

#+begin_src sh

  guix system -L ~/.dotfiles/.config/guix/systems init path/to/config.scm /mnt

#+end_src

This could take a while, so make sure your laptop is plugged in and let it run.  If you see any errors during installation, don't fret, you can usually resume from where you left off because your Guix store will have any packages that were already installed.

*** Initial System Setup

Congrats!  You now have a new Guix system installed, reboot now to complete the initial setup of your user account.

The first thing you'll want to do when you land at the login prompt is login as =root= and immediately change the =root= and user passwords using =passwd= (there isn't a root password by default!):

#+begin_src sh

  passwd             # Set passwd for 'root'
  passwd <username>  # Set password for your user account (no angle brackets)

#+end_src

Now log into your user account and clone your dotfiles repository.

Since we used the =nonguix= channel to install the non-free Linux kernel, we'll need to make sure that channel is configured in our user account so that we have access to those packages the next time we =guix pull=.  At the moment I just symlink the Guix config folder from my =.dotfiles= to =~/.config/guix=:

#+begin_src sh

  ln -sf ~/.dotfiles/guix ~/.config/guix

#+end_src

Verify that your =channels.scm= file is in the target path (=~/.config/guix/channels.scm=) and then run =guix pull= to sync in the new channel.

Now you can install the packages that you want to use for day-to-day activities.  I separate different types of packages into individual manifest files and manage them with my =activate-profiles= script:

#+begin_src sh

  activate-profiles desktop emacs

#+end_src

Now the packages for these manifests will be installed and usable.  They can be updated in the future by using the =update-profiles= script.
